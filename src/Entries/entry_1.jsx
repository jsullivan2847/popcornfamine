Dave played drums on all the rest of the songs, but when we went into the studio to track drums we just forgot to record this song - which kind of worked out because I was attached to the demo drums that made it to the final version.</p>
<p>There was a band that played these songs - Dave Pohsell, Brita Van Tol, Ryan Hagan, and Melissa Caren
  which somehow only managed to play 2 shows in the course of a year and a half - although we practiced constantly.
  With "That's True" and the rest of the songs on the EP I hope to have captured the sounds we achieved in that time.

<p>If you made it here thank you for reading and listening.

          Yeah it's true. I do got you. Yeah it's true. <br />

          Lucky not to have to mow the lawn. Trying not to be so goddamn dramatic. Singing somebody else's songs - hope to
          see some familar faces. Missing what I got before it's gone - things I shouldn't be taking for granted.<br />
          <br />
          Yeah it's true. I do got you. Yeah it's true. This is not new. Yeah it's true.
